                <h3>Jose Ignacio</h3>
                <p> I was having a party for my daughter's 8th birthday and was looking for a way I could make is truly magical for her. I rented a massive bouncy castle that was delivered to my house with no problem. My daughter and her friends had a lovely time and very much enjoyed jumping and laughing in the castle. </p>

                 <h3>Maria Ortez</h3>
                  <p>My daughter's birthday was approaching and I was looking for possible ways to make it a fun and traditional experience for her. People in Denmark don't really use pinatas, but thankfully I found this amazing app and was able to get a cute pinata for my daugher. She was very happy with the amount of candy that came out of it.</p>

                  <p>I rented a trampoline for my kids for a whole month during the summer. I loved seeing my children that happy and actively spending time in the garden instead of playing video games at home.</p>
